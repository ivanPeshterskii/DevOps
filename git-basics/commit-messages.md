# Commit Messages Best Practices

Commit messages are an essential part of Git history.
They help developers understand **what changed and why**.

---

## Why good commit messages matter

- Make project history readable
- Help with debugging and rollbacks
- Improve collaboration in teams

---

## Structure of a good commit message

Short summary in imperative mood
Optional detailed explanation if needed


---

## Good examples

- Add git basics documentation
- Create initial folder structure
- Update README with project purpose
- Fix typo in branching guide

---

## Bad examples

- update
- fix
- changes
- stuff

---

## Simple rules

- Use present tense (Add, Fix, Update)
- Be concise but descriptive
- One logical change per commit
- Avoid unnecessary words

---

## Example

```bash
git commit -m "Add branching and commit message documentation"
